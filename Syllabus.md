Weekly sessions will include walkthroughs, discussions, code samples, and demonstrations, with an emphasis on real-world applicability. Students will be provided Microsoft-curated supplementary readings, as well as weekly example projects to optionally complete.



## Course Objectives

By the end of this course, students are expected to know how to:
 * Plan and manage an Azure AI solution
 * Implement decision support solutions
 * Implement computer vision solutions
 * Implement natural language processing solutions
 * Implement knowledge mining and document intelligence  solutions
 * Implement generative AI solutions

## Who Should Take This Course

This course is designed for three target audiences.
 1. People preparing for the AI 102 certification exam. 
    - This group is expected to have some existing knowledge of Azure, as well as some familiarity with Python or C#.
    - This group should thoroughly review and supplementary reading, which is targeted for the exam.
2. Developers seeking to learn how to integrate AI solutions into their applications.
    - This group is expected to have some existing knowledge of Azure, as well as some familiarity with Python or C#.
    - This group may also benefit from reading the supplementary reading materials, but should focus on completing weekly projects.
3. People looking to see specific examples and better understand AI use-cases.
    - This group will benefit most directly from the weekly hybrid discussions and demonstrations.

## AI 102 Exam Preparedness:
- 45ish questions
- multiple sections. 
- Need 700/1000 to pass. 
- The questions are lame.
- “Open book”
    - Access to Microsoft Learn and Docs, but you will be very time constrained.

### Types of questions to expect:
1.
   You have a computer vision resource named contoso1 that is hosted in the West US Azure region. You need to use the smart cropping feature. How should you complete the API URL? 
   
   `______/vision/3.1/`
   
   a. "api.projectoxford.ai"

   b. "westus.api.cognitive.microsoft.com"
   
   c. "contoso1.cognitiveservices.azure.com"

2. What does this Content Moderator score suggest?
