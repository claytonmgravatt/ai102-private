Clarifying the Use of Queries and Methods for Data Importation with Power BI
Power BI is an industry leader in self-service analytics. This service delivers large-scale business intelligence into the hands of the end user by leveraging familiar tools found in Excel and Analysis Services into a single streamlined application. Power BI takes advantage of data importation and query optimization techniques such as query folding and VertiPaq compression.

Explore the methods by which data is imported into Power BI
Explain what importation processes maximize efficiency
Reveal how these processes are relevant to query folding

Phase 1
Phase one happens during the selection of database from “Get Data”
